        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a Software Engineering student with a strong interest in web
          development. I enjoy creating interactive, user-friendly websites and
          learning how the web works from the ground up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m
          currently exploring more advanced tools and frameworks like React and
          Node.js. I love the creative side of web development as much as the
          technical challenges it brings.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student, I am always looking for opportunities to grow — whether
          it is building personal projects, collaborating with peers, or
          learning from open-source communities. My goal is to become a
          full-stack developer and contribute to real-world applications that
          make a difference.
        </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Here are some of the projects I have worked on:
          <a href="introductory course final project"
            >https://github.com/PrincessOkaroni/FINAL-PROJECT</a
          >
          <a href="project one- photography website"
            >https://github.com/PrincessOkaroni/Photography</a
          >
          <a href="project two akan name generator"
            >https://github.com/PrincessOkaroni/AKAN</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Each project showcases my skills in web development, from designing
          user interfaces to implementing functionality with JavaScript. I
          believe that hands-on experience is the best way to learn, and I’m
          excited to continue building more complex applications.
