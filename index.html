          Hello! I'm Purity Okaroni, a Software Engineering student with a
          passion for web development. This is my personal portfolio website
          where I showcase my projects and skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created this website to share my journey in software development and
          to connect with others who share similar interests. Here, you can find
          information about my projects, skills, and how to contact me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to explore my work and get in touch if you have any
          questions or opportunities!

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="./images/Okaroni.jpg" alt="Purity Okaroni" />
        </div>
        <p>
          I'm a Software Engineering student with a strong interest in web
          development. I enjoy creating interactive, user-friendly websites and
          learning how the web works from the ground up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m
          currently exploring more advanced tools and frameworks like React and
          Node.js. I love the creative side of web development as much as the
          technical challenges it brings.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student, I am always looking for opportunities to grow — whether
          it is building personal projects, collaborating with peers, or
          learning from open-source communities. My goal is to become a
          full-stack developer and contribute to real-world applications that
          make a difference.
        </p>

      <section id="projects">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the projects I have worked on:</p>
        <a
          href="https://princessokaroni.github.io/FINAL-PROJECT/"
          target="_blank"
          >Introductory Course Final Project</a
        >
        <a href="https://princessokaroni.github.io/Photography/" target="_blank"
          >Project One - Photography Website</a
        >
        <a href="https://princessokaroni.github.io/AKAN/" target="_blank"
          >Project Two - Akan Name Generator</a
        >
        <p>
          Each project showcases my skills in web development, from designing
          user interfaces to implementing functionality with JavaScript. I
          believe that hands-on experience is the best way to learn, and I’m
          excited to continue building more complex applications.
        </p>
