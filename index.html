        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a Software Engineering student with a strong interest in web
          development. I enjoy creating interactive, user-friendly websites and
          learning how the web works from the ground up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m
          currently exploring more advanced tools and frameworks like React and
          Node.js. I love the creative side of web development as much as the
          technical challenges it brings.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student, I am always looking for opportunities to grow — whether
          it is building personal projects, collaborating with peers, or
          learning from open-source communities. My goal is to become a
          full-stack developer and contribute to real-world applications that
          make a difference.
